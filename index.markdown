## About Me

![image](/images/xinyu.jpg){: style="float: left; width: 30%; height: auto; margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;"}


This is Xinyu! I am a Ph.D. student at the Department of Statistics and Data Science at the University of Pennsylvania, working with Dr. [Weijie Su](http://stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~suw/). In the meantime, I work with by Dr. [Tanwi Mallick](https://tanwimallick.github.io) at the Mathematics and Computer Science Division at the Argonne National Laboratory. 

My recent work focuses on probing and improving the safety aspects of deploying AI models. In general, I am interested in the theory and applications of machine learning and statistics. In my spare time, I also participate in hackathons and data science competitions. Here is my [CV](/assets/Yangxinyu_Xie_CV.pdf).

I finished my master’s degree in computer science at the University of Texas at Austin in 2021, advised by Dr. [Anna Gal](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~panni/) and Dr. [Ngoc Tran](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ngoc-tran-43aa9879/).
