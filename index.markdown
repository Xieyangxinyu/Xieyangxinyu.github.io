This is Xinyu! I am a Ph.D. student at the Department of Statistics and Data Science at the University of Pennsylvania, working with Dr. [Bhaswar B. Bhattacharya](http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~bhaswar/) and Dr. [Weijie Su](https://www.weijie-su.com). In the meantime, I work with by Dr. [Tanwi Mallick](https://tanwimallick.github.io) at the Mathematics and Computer Science Division at the Argonne National Laboratory.

I finished my masterâ€™s degree in computer science at the University of Texas at Austin in 2021, advised by Dr. [Anna Gal](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~panni/) and Dr. [Ngoc Tran](https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/ntran/). 

I like probability, combinatorics, and linear algebra. Here is my [CV](/assets/Yangxinyu_Xie_CV.pdf).
