This is Xinyu! I am a Ph.D. student at the Department of Statistics and Data Science at the University of Pennsylvania, working with Dr. [Weijie Su](https://www.weijie-su.com). 

I finished my master’s degree in theoretical computer science at the University of Texas at Austin in 2021, advised by Dr. [Anna Gal](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~panni/) and Dr. [Ngoc Tran](https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/ntran/).
